## Overview
---

My setup comprises of two separate desks.
One is my main desk with my computer for most of my school work, programming, etc.
The other desk holds some workspace goodies such as my 3D printer, soldering station, etc.
Below, I will break down my favorite tools and justifications for each component of my setup.

## Desk
---

So this was the first addition to my setup.
I built this desk when moving into my apartment for school and I decided to build a [butcher block counter top alex desk](https://www.tiktok.com/@speedytech77/video/7242129035101261098?lang=en) something like this for my original inspiration.
I mostly needed something **big**, **sturdy**, and **cheap**.
So, I bought one full-sized Alex cabinet with drawers, one Alex cabinet with no drawers and a shelf, and a Lowes' butcher block counter top.

For the desk itself, I coated + sanded it down for a full 3 iterations. Set it on top of some Alex drawer units and called it a day. I ended up adding some generic furniture 'feet' later for some more +z height. It required a lot more work than a finished counter top but I was able to get it, finish it to my desired color, etc. Also, being solid wood and not Ikea's cardboard material, I can drill into it with no problem.

My PC setup that lives on top is my pride and glory. Built and upgraded over time from my first ever PC, its something like a [ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) and I use it for basically everything. It dual boots Linux and Windows; at some point it also served as a [Hackintosh](https://hackintosh.com/) and has been with me through thick and thin.

It started off as a water-cooled full-tower ATX Intel build when I was in 5th grade but is currently an air-cooled mini-ITX AMD PC nearing college graduation. I'm not one to be sentimental toward anything I own, but my PC would be the closest thing to it. All components were slowly added on through gifts, personal Microcenter splurges, and Facebook marketplace finds.

## Workstation
---

For my workstation I wanted something different. The biggest thing here again was the space constraint.
I wanted a desk to hold my record player, soldering iron, and my 3D printing gear.
Also, similar to the lab spaces at school, I wanted to be able to stand while working. 

The challenge here was to have a standing desk sturdy enough for a 3D printer that was not too expensive. I found one from [FlexiSpot](https://www.flexispot.com/flexispot-pro-standing-desk-e7?srsltid=AfmBOoq7F62L2vq0K9l6brwiB5g6dQvTyGZkbSOrrRz3yX6URrIwHLmH) and so far no issues.
